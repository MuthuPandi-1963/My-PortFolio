      "As a Technical Trainer, I teach students how to build full-stack web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Python. I help students understand both frontend and backend technologies, guiding them through hands-on projects and real-world examples. My approach is to explain complex topics in simple terms so that every student can follow along. I also cover important concepts like data structures, algorithms, and how to connect the frontend and backend in full-stack development.",
